Currently, I am a PhD in pharmacogenomics at Dr. Margarete Fischer-Bosch institute of clinical pharmacology in Stuttgart, Germany. 
My research focuses on genetic factors contributing to drug variability including methods for exploring large omics datasets, with a heavy focus on biomarkers, e.g. risk of adverse drug reactions, and visualization.

I like data. Making it (yes, in the wet-lab e.g. NGS, high-throuput qPCR or arrays), statistically analysing it, visualizing it and even cleaning it. I do these things with some combination of R, Shiny and bash scripts.

When I am not working I love to play with my kids, and the drums with my band.
