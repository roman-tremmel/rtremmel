One of my repeating tasks at daily work is to investigate whether genetic variations including single nucleotide variants or larger structural variants are located or cover gene regions. 

Of course, when working with vcf files from e.g. NGS projects mostly the annotation already have been done by the company/bioinformatics using their own bash-pipeline. And if I'm working in my linux command line environment, I will also use tools such as [SnpSift](http://snpeff.sourceforge.net/SnpSift.html), [ANNOVAR](https://doc-openbio.readthedocs.io/projects/annovar/en/latest/) or even the webinterface of the latter one [wannovar](http://wannovar.wglab.org/). But, there are a lot of situations when I have a small list of variants in indefinite format in `R` and need very fast -without any transformation- the overlap with some genomic ranges and intervals. 

In the last years I used the `library(Gen
