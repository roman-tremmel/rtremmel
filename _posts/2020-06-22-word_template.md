![Word overview](/assets/img/word_template.png)

I was bored to format word documents for each paper, draft or manuscript again and again. So, I created a template with most of the neseccary or required stuff for scientific publishing.
It uses only five different styles, which is enough since most journals even don't like any formatting, including title, two headers (h1 & h2), standard text and captions as well as references. The latter one is maybe not needed if using a referenc manager.

On the title page (page one) I added a table for email adresses and [ORC-IDs](https://orcid.org/), which could directly be filled by the co-authors when circulating the draft.
